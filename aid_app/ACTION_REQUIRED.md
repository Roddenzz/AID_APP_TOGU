# ACTION REQUIRED: You must provide an "App Password"

The email sending is still failing with an **"Invalid user or password"** error.

The password `HvHboy228` that you have provided **WILL NOT WORK**.

This is because your Yandex account almost certainly has **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** enabled.

## You MUST generate a special "App Password" from your Yandex account settings.

### Please follow these instructions carefully:

1.  **Log in** to your Yandex email account (`prof.materialhelp@yandex.ru`) in your web browser.
2.  Navigate to **Account Settings**.
3.  Find the **Security** section.
4.  Look for **"App passwords"** (Пароли приложений).
5.  **Create a new app password**. Give it a name like "AidApp".
6.  Yandex will generate a new, long password for you. It will look something like `abracadabraqwertysdfg`.
7.  **Copy this newly generated password and provide it to me.**

I have already configured the username (`prof.materialhelp@yandex.ru`) and the server settings. The only thing missing is the correct **app password**.

The system will continue to fail until you provide this specific password.
