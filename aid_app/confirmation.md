Yes, the password has been changed. Here is the current content of the `lib/utils/email_config.dart` file:

```dart
class EmailConfig {
  // ...
  static const String smtpPassword = 'dalclpadjeuummpm'; // mailbox password/app password
  // ...
}
```

The `smtpPassword` is set to the new app password you provided. If you are still experiencing issues, please provide the new error message.
